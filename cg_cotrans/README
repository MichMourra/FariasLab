Package contents
----------------
Executable scripts for free-energy calculations:
  calc_consensus_contacts.py
  calc_absolute_energies.pyelec
  calc_elongation.py

Executable scripts for codon-usage calculations:
  calc_codon_usage.py
  calc_rare_enrichment.py
  calc_profile_comparison.py

Supporting files:
  codons.py
  fe.py
  polymer.py
  substructures.py

Dependencies
------------
In addition to packages included in the standard Python distribution,
this software package depends on the following Python packages:
  numpy     [www.numpy.org]
  scipy	    [www.scipy.org]
  networkx  [networkx.github.io]
  Bio	    [biopython.org]
  prody	    [prody.csb.pitt.edu]

The calc_consensus_contacts.py script also uses Clustal Omega [www.clustal.org/omega].
It is assumed that this tool is installed in the usual place, i.e., /usr/bin/clustalo,
although this path can be changed in the code.

Usage
-----
These scripts were designed to be run with Python version 3+.
The usage and options for all primary scripts can be found using the --help option, e.g.

  python3 calc_consensus_contacts.py --help

The default values for all optional arguments, shown in brackets in the help text,
match those used in the main text of the publication.

Example free-energy calculation
-------------------------------
Assuming that the files 1DDR.pdb.gz (downloaded from www.rcsb.org)
and folA.fasta (downloaded, for example, from www.ecogene.org) are located in the
current working directory, run:

  python3 calc_consensus_contacts.py folA.fasta 1DDR
  	  # Outputs polymer.dat
  python3 calc_absolute_energies.py polymer.dat
  	  # Outputs polymer_abs_energies.dat
  python3 calc_elongation.py folA polymer_abs_energies.dat
  	  # Outputs folA_elongation_profile.dat

Codon-usage and rare-codon calculations
---------------------------------------
These scripts require input multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) fasta files, which
can be created using standard tools such as Clustal Omega.  In addition, the protein
abundances for the genes of interest are needed; one such reference is given in the
publication.  The calc_codon_usage script should be run first to generate the
genome-wide codon statistics.  The calc_enrichment_script should then be run once
for each gene.  Finally, the profile-comparison script assumes that the
elongation-profile and rare-codon-profile files have names like
folA_elongation_profile.dat and folA_rc_profile.dat, where folA is a gene name.
